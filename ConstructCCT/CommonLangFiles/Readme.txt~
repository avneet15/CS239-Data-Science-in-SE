The folder has the following structure

1. ins folder : It has all the instrumented test classes and main java classes. 
		To generate output, we need to run the *Test.class files as junit tests

2. Jline_outputs : It has the following files
		   1. Calling context tree
		   2. 2 length patterns
		   3. 100 length patterns
		   4. global method counts


3. Jline_scripts : It has the script files used to create .class files for test files as well as main java files
		   239_draft.sh : generates the output from ins folder
	           239.sh and 239_test.sh requires ASM class files which needs to be placed in target/classes and target/test-classes respectively
